This means that for some Icicles commands, such as `icicle-search' and
`icicle-select-region', the normal completion candidate is treated as
a multi-completion: the name of the buffer associated with it is added
to the candidate and highlighted.

The main advantage is that you can easily see which buffer a candidate
applies to.  Also, the buffer name is part of the candidate, so you
can match against it.

Note that even when the value is nil, you can use `C-M-mouse-2' and so
on to see information about a candidate, and this information includes
its buffer name whenever a non-nil value would have shown the buffer
name."

This has the advantage of not requiring you to use `M-n' to

you use `M-p' (or do something else) to get rid of the default

The particular non-nil value determines whether or not the value is
preselected and, if preselected, where the cursor is left: at the
beginning or end of the value.  Possible values:

  nil               - Do not insert default value.
  `insert'          - Insert default value (leave cursor at end).

  `preselect-end'   - Insert and preselect default value;

My own preference is `insert'.  This is not the value by default only
because people are not used to it.  I recommend that you try `insert'
for a while, before giving up on it.

Preselection can be useful in Delete Selection mode or PC Selection
mode.  It makes it easy to replace the value by typing characters, or
delete it by hitting `C-d' or `DEL' (backspace).  However, all of the

This is a cons cell whose car and cdr may each be empty.

The car of the cons cell is a list of functions that grab different
kinds of strings at or near point.  By default, there are four
functions, which grab 1) whatever `ffap-guesser' finds, 2) the symbol
or file name, 3) the word, 4) the URL at point.  Any number of
functions can be used.  They are used in sequence by command
`icicle-insert-string-at-point' (bound to `M-.').

The cdr of the cons cell is nil or a function that advances point one
text thing.  Each time command `icicle-insert-string-at-point' is
called successively, this is called to grab more things of text (of
the same kind).  By default, successive words are grabbed.

If either the car or cdr is empty, then the other alone determines the
behavior of `icicle-insert-string-at-point'.  Otherwise, option
`icicle-default-thing-insertion' determines whether the car or cdr is
used by `icicle-insert-string-at-point'.  `C-u' with no number

example, when you use `C-c C-`' (\ `icicle-search-generic') in a
*shell* buffer, Icicles uses this variable with a value of
`icicle-remove-duplicates', to remove duplicate shell commands from
your input history list.

duplicates, by binding it to `icicle-remove-duplicates'."
