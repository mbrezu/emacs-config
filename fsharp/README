                == F# mode for Emacs ==



This is the first release of this fsharp-mode. It contains bugs,
but I hope it will be useful to some people (actually, it is at
least for me). The code is messy. I'm sorry, I've merged and patched
OCaml-mode and Python-mode together.


 1) Installation


I have the following lines in my .emacs file.
Just copy them and adapt values, it should work.

(setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/fsharp" load-path))
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '("\\.fs[iylx]?$" . fsharp-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'fsharp-mode "fsharp" "Major mode for editing F# code." t)
(autoload 'run-fsharp "inf-fsharp" "Run an inferior F# process." t)


To set the path to te compiler and the interactive mode, you
can use this:

(setq inferior-fsharp-program "c:\\pathto\\fsi.exe\"")
(setq fsharp-compiler "\"c:\\pathto\\fsc.exe\"")


 2) Features

- Interactive F# buffer
- Indentation
- Syntax highlighter


 3) Bindings


Here are a few useful bindings:

- C-c C-r       Evaluate region
- C-c C-e       Evaluate current toplevel phrase
- C-M-x         Evaluate current toplevel phrase
- C-M-h         Mark current toplevel phrase
- C-c C-s       Show interactive buffer
- C-c C-c       Compile with fsc
- C-c C-a       Open alternate file (.fsi or .fs)
- C-c l         Shift region to left
- C-c r         Shift region to right



Known bugs:
 - there are problems with paths with a space. You can add fsc to the
path and call "fsc.exe". Or create a .bat/.sh script file to call
the real file. Or fix the bug and send me the patch. :)


If you have problems with installation, please ask me.

Please fix them!

Please don't send feature requests!
